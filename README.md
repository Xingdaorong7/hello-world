# hello-world
a total new study from zero
2021-12-23 22:33 wsh with his friends went to eat a large panel chicken, safe and sound. When we back lab, I swapped the K+ and gen+ solid LB for next day E.coli PCR detect. After that, I wanted to study english, so I turnned to GitHub, hoping I can learn the right something. Now I think I know what is branch, what is repository, what is feature and merge, what is commit. And I see it's not bad for going to bed late.
That is all.
